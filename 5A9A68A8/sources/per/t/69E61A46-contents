My name is Caroline Maramara and I am a graduate student in the Geoinformatics program at Hunter College. This is my first website and I have made it for a class called WebGIS.

As an avid New York City diner, I have often found myself arriving at a restaurant, only to find that they have a B rating. I have often had the conversation with my friends about how it would be great to have a place to check restaurant health ratings as well as violations and citations issued to the establishment.

I hope this website helps bring the information to the masses and helps you become a more informed eater.
