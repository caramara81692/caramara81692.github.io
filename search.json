This is my first website and I have made it for a class called WebGIS.\nAs an avid New York City diner, I have often found myself arriving at a restaurant, only to find that they have a B rating. I have often had the conversation with my friends about how it would be great to have a place to check restaurant health ratings as well as violations and citations issued to the establishment.\nI hope this website helps bring the information to the masses and helps you become a more informed eater."
